/* js/get_saved_tweets.js
 * Keep this starter-style simple global. Your HTML already loads this before other scripts.
 * If your file already defines RUNKEEPER_TWEETS the same way, you can keep your version.
 */

// If RUNKEEPER_TWEETS is already populated by your starter, this is not needed.
// Typical starter uses an inline script that sets RUNKEEPER_TWEETS from data/saved_tweets.json
// Example shape (do NOT duplicate if you already have it!):
//   const RUNKEEPER_TWEETS = [ { text: "...", created_at: "..." }, ... ];
//
// Leaving this file minimal on purpose.
